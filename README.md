# Shravani Kode ðŸŒŸ

### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shravani, an Electrical Engineering undergrad at IIT Bombay, navigating the exciting world of hardware acceleration and machine learning! ðŸ’»âš¡

- ðŸ”­ Currently optimizing ML models on FPGAs and RISC-V architectures
- ðŸŒ± Exploring reinforcement learning for hardware design
- ðŸš€ Passionate about bridging the gap between AI and edge computing

When I'm not buried in code or wrestling with frameworks, you can find me binge-watching sitcoms or staring at the sky, hoping to catch a meteor shower! ðŸŒ âœ¨

Feel free to reach out to me at [shravani.kode@gmail.com](mailto:shravani.kode@gmail.com) or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shravani-kode/)!
